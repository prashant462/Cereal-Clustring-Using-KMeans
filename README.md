<h1>Cereal Clustring Using K-Means</h1>

<h4>Purpose of project is to applying K means clustering, on a
cereal dataset and tocontrast the results found on the number 
of clusters weather the optimal or best number of clusters to
be 3 or 5, we get to this generalization by applying different
clustering tests and visualizations. We have reached
above conclusion by firstly doing exploratory analysis, then
did model fitting followed by result testing, leading us to final
conclusion.</h4>
